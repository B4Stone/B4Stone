Transforming a passion for cyber security to a professional skill set, one project at a time.

## Objective


Through my 10-year career as an operations manager I have realized a love of solving issues with tech devices. This inspired me to learn more about computer science and has led me to develop a passion for cyber security, and network management. I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
